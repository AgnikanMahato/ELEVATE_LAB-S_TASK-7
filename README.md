# SVM Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification on a breast cancer dataset using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Project Structure
- `svm_breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all code, explanations, and results.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `images/`: Folder containing all result plots and visualizations generated by the notebook.

## Main Steps in the Notebook
1. **Import Libraries**: Loads all necessary Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
2. **Load and Explore Data**: Reads the dataset, displays sample rows, checks for missing values, and visualizes the target distribution.
3. **Preprocessing**: Handles categorical encoding, missing values, and splits the data into training and test sets with robust error handling.
4. **SVM Training**:
   - Trains SVM with both linear and RBF kernels.
   - Evaluates and prints accuracy for both models.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plots a beautiful target distribution graph.
   - Visualizes SVM decision boundaries in 2D using PCA.
   - Saves all result plots to the `images/` folder.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses GridSearchCV to find the best SVM parameters (C, gamma) for the RBF kernel.
7. **Evaluation**: Performs cross-validation, shows confusion matrix, and prints a classification report.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook `svm_breast_cancer_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run each cell in order. All result plots will be saved automatically in the `images/` folder.
3. Review the markdown explanations and code comments for understanding each step.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Install requirements (if needed):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Results
- All major results and plots are saved in the `images/` folder for easy access.
- The notebook is robust to common data issues and provides clear error messages.
